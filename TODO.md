# TODOS

* undo the pushstate thing, it's weird
* improve the responsive design, it's screwy
* consider how the design can flex based on how many folders there are -- what if someone has twenty?
* do a total google-reader style keyboard shortcut system?
* detect whether it's on a platform that supports flash, and then tell the app (/get/flash/false, stores in the session hash) and then *don't* serve hulu; or serve it folded?
* make this a full Instapaper client?
* like, show *all links* and then if it's a video, include the video
* if it's an instagram, show the gram
* use ajax for the `/add` button (re-implement it)
