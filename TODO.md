# TODOS

* detect whether it's on a platform that supports flash, and then tell the app (/get/flash/false, stores in the session hash) and then *don't* serve hulu; or serve it folded?
* if you click move on one video, and then move on another video, what happens and what are your expectations?
* improve the responsive design, it's screwy
* consider how the design can flex based on how many folders there are -- what if someone has twenty?
* do a total google-reader style keyboard shortcut system?
* use ajax for the `/add` button (re-implement it)
* make this a full Instapaper client?
    * like, show *all links* and then if it's a video, include the video
    * if it's an instagram, show the gram
