# TODOS

* add a little drop shadow under the header?
* make this a full Instapaper client?
* like, show *all links* and then if it's a video, include the video
* if it's an instagram, show the gram
* etc
* TODO get rid of oembed it's slow and buggy
* related: is that potentially also a solution to the Big Bug? maybe I can do like `loadcode/vimeo/1234` that returns a string...? maybe not
* use ajax for the `/add` button (re-implement it)
