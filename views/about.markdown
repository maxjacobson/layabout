## about

[YouTube][], [Vimeo][], and [Hulu][] all separately provide a queueing system for watching videos later, but I find myself not remembering to check so many different places, so I just throw it all into [Instapaper][].

[Vimeo]: https://vimeo.com/blog/post:334
[Hulu]: http://www.hulu.com/support/article/166520
[Instapaper]: http://www.instapaper.com

Which is awesome.

I sometimes wish I could peruse my Instapaper queue and see just the videos, so I created Layabout.

Layabout supports YouTube, Vimeo, and Hulu so far. I may support some others. [Let me know at @layaboutapp on twitter][] what I'm missing. Anything that supports [oEmbed][] should be able to work.

Layabout requires a paid [Instapaper Subscription][]. In my experience it's worth it, for search and the ability to use third-party apps like this.

Layabout is a [Sinatra][] app written in [Ruby][], hosted on [Heroku][], and wearing [Bootstrap][]'s CSS.

This is pretty much the first thing I've made. Reach me at [max@maxjacobson.net][].
