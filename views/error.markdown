## 505

There was an error.

Try [visiting the front page](/) and if you still see this error, then the site is well and truly broken for you right now.

At this point, it's most likely the error is because there's a link among your bookmarks that is now dead or does not allow embedding. It's on my to do list to deal with those videos.

Sorry for the fuckup.
