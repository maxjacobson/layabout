## What it is

A site for Instapaper subscribers to go to and watch all the videos they've saved. Just kick back and enjoy.

## Notes

* 2012-11-03, got my Instapaper API credentials. Time to figure out how the fuck to use it.
* 2012-11-05, exploring rubygems.org and github for people who already did some of this work. probably going to use the gem `instapaper_full` which seems quite slick
* thought: offer some sorting options, so people can watch the shorter or longer ones depending on their mood. allow search.
* 2012-11-08, set it up as a sinatra app yesterday
* today did some URL and Title cleanup. OEmbed is finicky and will only accept clean URLs which is fine by me.
* added support for youtube short urls (`youtu.be/`) and mobile (`m.youtube.com`)
