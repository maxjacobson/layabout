# Layabout

## What it is

A site for Instapaper subscribers to go to and watch all the videos they've saved. Just kick back and enjoy.

## Notes

* 2012-11-03, got my Instapaper API credentials. Time to figure out how the fuck to use it.

They are:

Title: Layabout
OAuth consumer key: CAylHIEIhqdEI0LX4GQp0RcUoLkLQml0VfKIoaRyueKpwgjMop
OAuth consumer secret: UYdf9isHWJTJtBjXQvbwTSYQU4Q8kyqm2x7l3jBLL3Kjju8Nhg

* 2012-11-05, exploring rubygems.org and github for people who already did some of this work. probably going to use the gem `instapaper_full` which seems quite slick
* thought: offer some sorting options, so people can watch the shorter or longer ones depending on their mood. allow search.
